How to install the extension
----------------------------

Here are the instructions for Mac OS X. They are certainly very similar on
Linux. First of all, you need to install Firefox. Then, check out this repo, and
cd into it. Then:

    cd ./ff-ext
    pwd > phinishphish@lucas.maystre.ch
    # Replace {PROFILE} with the name of your Firefox profile.
    mv phinishphish@lucas.maystre.ch /Users/$USER/Library\
    /Application\ Support/Firefox/Profiles/{PROFILE}/extensions/

Restart Firefox, and you should be good to go!
