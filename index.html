  <h1>Phinishing Phishing</h1>
  
  <p>This page is under active development, you're invited to check back in a
  few weeks.</p>
  <h2>Firefox extension</h2>

  <p>Here are some screenshots of the extension, and basic explanations on how
  it is used. Most of the time, you don't feel its presence. It is triggered
  only when a web site is not "known" (i.e., not in a list of millions of "good"
  sites).</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You visit a webpage, thinking it is PayPal. But if you look carefully,
    the domain name (in the address bar) has nothing to do with PayPal!</li>
    <li>When you submit the login information, a new window pops up and asks you
    to tell it what your intention is.</li>
    <li>You confirm that you intended to visit PayPal by clicking on the
    logo.</li>
    <li>The extension understands that the current web page is looking like
    PayPal, but knows that it is not the legitimate site. Therefore, the request
    is blocked, and a warning is shown.</li>
  </ol>
